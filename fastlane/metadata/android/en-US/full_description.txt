<b>LEGACY: The OpenMax API is deprecated, you need a 32 bit RPI OS and omxplayer installed to run it.</b>

<b>&#8226;</b> Cast YouTube videos
<b>&#8226;</b> Cast media content from your android device
<b>&#8226;</b> Play local media files on your Raspberry Pi
<b>&#8226;</b> Play streams from playlists (m3u, pls) on your Raspberry Pi

<u><b>Requirements:</b></u>
You just need a<b> Raspberry Pi </b>with a running <b>SSH-Server</b>, the <b>omxplayer</b> and optional a little image viewer. I only tested it with Raspbian, but there is no reason why it shouldn't work on other distributions. 

<u><b>Features:</b></u>
<b>&#8226;</b> Controllable via a seekbar
<b>&#8226;</b> Hardware volume buttons
<b>&#8226;</b> Support for multiple audio and subtitle (srt-format) streams

<u><b>Usage:</b></u>
<b>&#8226;</b> To cast YouTube videos to your Raspberry Pi just open the YouTube app and a video and choose "Share" &rarr; Raspicast.
<b>&#8226;</b> To play streams just copy a playlist (m3u or pls format) to your android device and open the list via the app, or play the streams manually from the actionbar.
